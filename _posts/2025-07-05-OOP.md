## OOP: In terms of maintenance

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is often praised for its maintainability, largely due to the concept of the object itself. In my experience, well structured objects has played a crucial role building abstract ideas into concrete, real code. 
Without objects, it is really difficult to build systems, as they are reflection of human mind, makes easy to maintain robust software and understand code blocks.

However, some strict OOP followers tend to apply the 4 features to software without considering actual context of code blocks. For instance, Deep hierarchies are often unnecessary in simpe CRUD or API-serving applications.
